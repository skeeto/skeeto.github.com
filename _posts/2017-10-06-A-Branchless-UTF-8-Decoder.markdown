This week I took a crack at writing a branchless [UTF-8][rfc] decoder:
a function that decodes a single UTF-8 code point from a byte stream
without any `if` statements, loops, short-circuit operators, or other
sorts of conditional jumps. You can find the source code here along
with a test suite and benchmark:

* <https://github.com/skeeto/branchless-utf8>

In addition to decoding the next code point, it detects any errors and
returns a pointer to the next code point. It's the complete package.

Why branchless? Because high performance CPUs are pipelined. That is,
a single instruction is executed over a series of stages, and many
instructions are executed in overlapping time intervals, each at a
different stage.

The usual analogy is laundry. You can have more than one load of
laundry in process at a time because laundry is typically a pipelined
process. There's a washing machine stage, dryer stage, and folding
stage. One load can be in the washer, a second in the drier, and a
third being folded, all at once. This greatly increases throughput
because, under ideal circumstances with a full pipeline, an
instruction is completed each clock cycle despite any individual
instruction taking many clock cycles to complete.

Branches are the enemy of pipelines. The CPU can't begin work on the
next instruction if it doesn't know which instruction will be executed
next. It must finish computing the branch condition before it can
know. To deal with this, pipelined CPUs are also equipped with *branch
predictors*. It makes a guess at which branch will be taken and begins
executing instructions on that branch. The prediction is initially
made using static heuristics, and later those predictions are improved
[by learning from previous behavior][uarch]. This even includes
predicting the number of iterations of a loop so that the final
iteration isn't mispredicted.

A mispredicted branch has two dire consequences. First, all the
progress on the incorrect branch will need to be discarded. Second,
the pipeline will be flushed, and the CPU will be inefficient until
the pipeline fills back up with instructions on the correct branch.
With a sufficiently deep pipeline, it can easily be **more efficient
to compute and discard an unneeded result than to avoid computing it
in the first place**. Eliminating branches means eliminating the
hazards of misprediction.

Another hazard for pipelines is *dependencies*. If an instruction
depends on the result of a previous instruction, it may have to wait for
the previous instruction to make sufficient progress before it can
complete one of its stages. This is known as a *pipeline stall*, and it
is an important consideration in instruction set architecture (ISA)
design.

For example, on the x86-64 architecture, storing a 32-bit result in a
64-bit register will automatically clear the upper 32 bits of that
register. Any further use of that destination register cannot depend on
prior instructions since all bits have been set. This particular
optimization was missed in the design of the i386: Writing a 16-bit
result to 32-bit register leaves the upper 16 bits intact, creating
false dependencies.

Dependency hazards are mitigated using *out-of-order execution*.
Rather than execute two dependent instructions back to back, which
would result in a stall, the CPU may instead executing an independent
instruction further away in between. A good compiler will also try to
spread out dependent instructions in its own instruction scheduling.

The effects of out-of-order execution are typically not visible to a
single thread, where everything will appear to have executed in order.
However, when multiple processes or threads can access the same memory
[out-of-order execution can be observed][reorder]. It's one of the
many [challenges of writing multi-threaded software][lf].

The focus of my UTF-8 decoder was to be branchless, but there was one
interesting dependency hazard that neither GCC nor Clang were able to
resolve themselves. More on that later.

### What is UTF-8?

Without getting into the history of it, you can generally think of
[UTF-8][utf8] as a method for encoding a series of 21-bit integers
(*code points*) into a stream of bytes.

* Shorter integers encode to fewer bytes than larger integers. The
  shortest available encoding must be chosen, meaning there is one
  canonical encoding for a given sequence of code points.

* Certain code points are off limits: *surrogate halves*. These are
  code points `U+D800` through `U+DFFF`. Surrogates are used in UTF-16
  to represent code points above U+FFFF and serve no purpose in UTF-8.
  This has [interesting consequences][wtf8] for pseudo-Unicode
  strings, such "wide" strings in the Win32 API, where surrogates may
  appear unpaired. Such sequences cannot legally be represented in
  UTF-8.

Keeping in mind these two rules, the entire format is summarized by
this table:

    length byte[0]  byte[1]  byte[2]  byte[3]
    1      0xxxxxxx
    2      110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
    3      1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
    4      11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

The `x` placeholders are the bits of the encoded code point.

UTF-8 has some really useful properties:

* It's backwards compatible with ASCII, which never used the highest
  bit.

* Sort order is preserved. Sorting a set of code point sequences has the
  same result as sorting their UTF-8 encoding.

* No additional zero bytes are introduced. In C we can continue using
  null terminated `char` buffers, often without even realizing they
  hold UTF-8 data.

* It's self-synchronizing. A leading byte will never be mistaken for a
  continuation byte. This allows for byte-wise substring searches,
  meaning UTF-8 unaware functions like `strstr(3)` continue to work
  without modification (except for normalization issues). It also
  allows for unambiguous recovery of a damaged stream.

A straightforward approach to decoding might look something like this:

```c
unsigned char *
utf8_simple(unsigned char *s, long *c)
{
    unsigned char *next;
    if (s[0] < 0x80) {
        *c = s[0];
        next = s + 1;
    } else if ((s[0] & 0xe0) == 0xc0) {
        *c = ((long)(s[0] & 0x1f) <<  6) |
             ((long)(s[1] & 0x3f) <<  0);
        next = s + 2;
    } else if ((s[0] & 0xf0) == 0xe0) {
        *c = ((long)(s[0] & 0x0f) << 12) |
             ((long)(s[1] & 0x3f) <<  6) |
             ((long)(s[2] & 0x3f) <<  0);
        next = s + 3;
    } else if ((s[0] & 0xf8) == 0xf0 && (s[0] <= 0xf4)) {
        *c = ((long)(s[0] & 0x07) << 18) |
             ((long)(s[1] & 0x3f) << 12) |
             ((long)(s[2] & 0x3f) <<  6) |
             ((long)(s[3] & 0x3f) <<  0);
        next = s + 4;
    } else {
        *c = -1; // invalid
        next = s + 1; // skip this byte
    }
    if (*c >= 0xd800 && *c <= 0xdfff)
        *c = -1; // surrogate half
    return next;
}
```

It branches off on the highest bits of the leading byte, extracts all of
those `x` bits from each byte, concatenates those bits, checks if it's a
surrogate half, and returns a pointer to the next character. (This
implementation does *not* check that the highest two bits of each
continuation byte are correct.)

The CPU must correctly predict the length of the code point or else it
will suffer a hazard. An incorrect guess will stall the pipeline and
slow down decoding.

In real world text this is probably not a serious issue. For the
English language, the encoded length is nearly always a single byte.
However, even for non-English languages, text is [usually accompanied
by markup from the ASCII range of characters][every], and, overall,
the encoded lengths will still have consistency. As I said, the CPU
predicts branches based on the program's previous behavior, so this
means it will temporarily learn some of the statistical properties of
the language being actively decoded. Pretty cool, eh?

Eliminating branches from the decoder side-steps any issues with
mispredicting encoded lengths. Only errors in the stream will cause
stalls. Since that's probably the unusual case, the branch predictor
will be very successful by continually predicting success. That's one
optimistic CPU.

### The branchless decoder

Here's the interface to my branchless decoder:

```c
void *utf8_decode(void *buf, uint32_t *c, int *e);
```

I chose `void *` for the buffer so that it doesn't care what type was
actually chosen to represent the buffer. It could be a `uint8_t`,
`char`, `unsigned char`, etc. Doesn't matter. The encoder accesses it
only as bytes.

On the other hand, with this interface you're forced to use `uint32_t`
to represent code points. You could always change the function to suit
your own needs, though.

Errors are returned in `e`. It's zero for success and non-zero when an
error was detected, without any particular meaning for different values.
Error conditions are mixed into this integer, so a zero simply means the
absence of error.

This is where you could accuse me of "cheating" a little bit. The
caller probably wants to check for errors, and so *they* will have to
branch on `e`. It seems I've just smuggled the branches outside of the
decoder.

However, as I pointed out, unless you're expecting lots of errors, the
real cost is branching on encoded lengths. Furthermore, the caller
could instead accumulate the errors: count them, or make the error
"sticky" by ORing all `e` values together. Neither of these require a
branch. The caller could decode a huge stream and only check for
errors at the very end. The only branch would be the main loop ("are
we done yet?"), which is trivial to predict with high accuracy.

The first thing the function does is extract the encoded length of the
next code point:

```c
    static const char lengths[] = {
        1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
        0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0
    };

    unsigned char *s = buf;
    int len = lengths[s[0] >> 3];
```

Looking back to the UTF-8 table above, only the highest 5 bits determine
the length. That's 32 possible values. The zeros are for invalid
prefixes. This will later cause a bit to be set in `e`.

With the length in hand, it can compute the position of the next code
point in the buffer.

```c
    unsigned char *next = s + len + !len;
```

Originally this expression was the return value, computed at the very
end of the function. However, after inspecting the compiler's assembly
output, I decided to move it up, and the result was a solid performance
boost. That's because it spreads out dependent instructions. With the
address of the next code point known so early, [the instructions that
decode the next code point can get started early][carruth].

The reason for the `!len` is so that the pointer is advanced one byte
even in the face of an error (length of zero). Adding that `!len` is
actually somewhat costly, though I couldn't figure out why.

```c
    static const int shiftc[] = {0, 18, 12, 6, 0};

    *c  = (uint32_t)(s[0] & masks[len]) << 18;
    *c |= (uint32_t)(s[1] & 0x3f) << 12;
    *c |= (uint32_t)(s[2] & 0x3f) <<  6;
    *c |= (uint32_t)(s[3] & 0x3f) <<  0;
    *c >>= shiftc[len];
```

This reads four bytes regardless of the actual length. Avoiding doing
something is branching, so this can't be helped. The unneeded bits are
shifted out based on the length. That's all it takes to decode UTF-8
without branching.

One important consequence of always reading four bytes is that **the
caller *must* zero-pad the buffer to at least four bytes**. In practice,
this means padding the entire buffer with three bytes in case the last
character is a single byte.

The padding must be zero in order to detect errors. Otherwise the
padding might look like legal continuation bytes.

```c
    static const uint32_t mins[] = {4194304, 0, 128, 2048, 65536};
    static const int shifte[] = {0, 6, 4, 2, 0};

    *e  = (*c < mins[len]) << 6;
    *e |= ((*c >> 11) == 0x1b) << 7;  // surrogate half?
    *e |= (s[1] & 0xc0) >> 2;
    *e |= (s[2] & 0xc0) >> 4;
    *e |= (s[3]       ) >> 6;
    *e ^= 0x2a;
    *e >>= shifte[len];
```

The first line checks if the shortest encoding was used, setting a bit
in `e` if it wasn't. For a length of 0, this always fails.

The second line checks for a surrogate half by checking for a certain
prefix.

The next three lines accumulate the highest two bits of each
continuation byte into `e`. Each should be the bits `10`. These bits are
"compared" to `101010` (`0x2a`) using XOR. The XOR clears these bits as
long as they exactly match.

Finally the continuation prefix bits that don't matter are shifted out.

### The goal

My primary — and totally arbitrary — goal was to beat the performance of
[Björn Höhrmann's DFA-based decoder][bh]. Under favorable (and
artificial) benchmark conditions I had moderate success. You can try it
out on your own system by cloning the repository and running `make
bench`.

With GCC 6.3.0 on an i7-6700, my decoder is about 20% faster than the
DFA decoder in the benchmark. With Clang 3.8.1 it's just 1% faster.

*Update*: [Björn pointed out][issue] that his site includes a faster
variant of his DFA decoder. It is only 10% slower than the branchless
decoder with GCC, and it's 20% faster than the branchless decoder with
Clang. So, in a sense, it's still faster on average, even on a
benchmark that favors a branchless decoder.

The benchmark operates very similarly to [my PRNG shootout][prng] (e.g.
`alarm(2)`). First a buffer is filled with random UTF-8 data, then the
decoder decodes it again and again until the alarm fires. The
measurement is the number of bytes decoded.

The number of errors is printed at the end (always 0) in order to force
errors to actually get checked for each code point. Otherwise the sneaky
compiler omits the error checking from the branchless decoder, making it
appear much faster than it really is — a serious letdown once I noticed
my error. Since the other decoder is a DFA and error checking is built
into its graph, the compiler can't really omit its error checking.

I called this "favorable" because the buffer being decoded isn't
anything natural. Each time a code point is generated, first a length is
chosen uniformly: 1, 2, 3, or 4. Then a code point that encodes to that
length is generated. The **even distribution of lengths greatly favors a
branchless decoder**. The random distribution inhibits branch
prediction. Real text has a far more favorable distribution.

```c
uint32_t
randchar(uint64_t *s)
{
    uint32_t r = rand32(s);
    int len = 1 + (r & 0x3);
    r >>= 2;
    switch (len) {
        case 1:
            return r % 128;
        case 2:
            return 128 + r % (2048 - 128);
        case 3:
            return 2048 + r % (65536 - 2048);
        case 4:
            return 65536 + r % (131072 - 65536);
    }
    abort();
}
```

Given the odd input zero-padding requirement and the artificial
parameters of the benchmark, despite the supposed 20% speed boost
under GCC, my branchless decoder is not really any better than the DFA
decoder in practice. It's just a different approach. In practice I'd
prefer Björn's DFA decoder.

*Update*: Bryan Donlan has followed up with [a SIMD UTF-8 decoder][simd].

*Update 2024*: NRK has followed up with [parallel extract decoder][nrk].

*Update 2025*: Charles Eckman followed up [sharing a branchless
encoder][enc], which inspired me to [give it a shot][gist].
